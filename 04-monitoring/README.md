# Module 4: Evaluation and Monitoring

In this module, we will learn how to evaluate and monitor our LLM and RAG system.

In the evaluation part, we assess the quality of our entire RAG
system before it goes live.

In the monitoring part, we collect, store and visualize
metrics to assess the answer quality of a deployed LLM. We also
collect chat history and user feedback.
